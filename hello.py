# Welcome, new coder.
# Enter your code on line 7 to print 'Hello, World!'
# to the console (the panel on the right)

# print("Hello");
# print("32");
# print('then I said, "i am goood at this"');
# print("Hello, world!")

print("hello, " + " world!" + "this is one line.")
name = "f-string"
print(f"hello, {name}! this is on one line.")

print('And then he said, "hey man"')

# Next, PLAY!
# Modify your code on line 7 to try to accomplish the tasks listed below:

#   1. Change the message that is printed.
#   2. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
#   3. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using a single or a double quote (' vs. ")?
#   4. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
#   5. Print multiple messages one after the other.
#   6. Print two messages on the same line.
#   7. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as Quoth the Raven "Nevermore".
#   8. Other. You choose!
